I don't do this myself but family of mine does it and it's a very common technique that I thought might be worth your interest. It's to remove what is called <U+81BB><U+5473> (Shan wei) roughly translated as gameyness and for hygiene too. & Leaving food out at room temperature I believe is an overrated concern for cooked meat and cooked meals - but I'd love to hear what the research says. I often leave food out wrapped in plastic wrap on the dinner table overnight and eat it the next day, haven't yet had any problems from it. This might be related to the fact that I cook Chinese food, so all meats and vegetables are cooked through & NA\\\\\n",

I don't do this myself but family of mine does it and it's a very common technique that I thought might be worth your interest. It's to remove what is called &lt;U+81BB&gt;&lt;U+5473&gt; (Shan wei) roughly translated as gameyness and for hygiene too. | Leaving food out at room temperature I believe is an overrated concern for cooked meat and cooked meals - but I'd love to hear what the research says. I often leave food out wrapped in plastic wrap on the dinner table overnight and eat it the next day, haven't yet had any problems from it. This might be related to the fact that I cook Chinese food, so all meats and vegetables are cooked through | NA |\n",
